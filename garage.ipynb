    "# Your parking garage class should have the following methods:\n",
    "# - takeTicket\n",
    "# - This should decrease the amount of tickets available by 1\n",
    "# - This should decrease the amount of parkingSpaces available by 1\n",
    "# - payForParking\n",
    "# - Display an input that waits for an amount from the user and store it in a variable\n",
    "# - If the payment variable is not empty then (meaning the ticket has been paid) -> display a message to the user that their ticket has been paid and they have 15mins to leave\n",
    "# - This should update the \"currentTicket\" dictionary key \"paid\" to True\n",
    "# -leaveGarage\n",
    "# - If the ticket has been paid, display a message of \"Thank You, have a nice day\"\n",
    "# - If the ticket has not been paid, display an input prompt for payment\n",
    "# - Once paid, display message \"Thank you, have a nice day!\"\n",
